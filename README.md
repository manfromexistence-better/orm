### What's Drizzle?
Drizzle is a modern TypeScript ORM developers [wanna use in their next project](https://stateofdb.com/tools/drizzle). 
It is [lightweight](https://bundlephobia.com/package/drizzle-orm) at only ~7.4kb minified+gzipped, and it's tree shakeable with exactly 0 dependencies. 

**Drizzle supports every PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite database**, including serverless ones like [Turso](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started-sqlite#turso), [Neon](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started-postgresql#neon), [Xata](xata.io), [PlanetScale](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started-mysql#planetscale), [Cloudflare D1](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started-sqlite#cloudflare-d1), [FlyIO LiteFS](https://fly.io/docs/litefs/), [Vercel Postgres](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started-postgresql#vercel-postgres), [Supabase](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started-postgresql#supabase) and [AWS Data API](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started-postgresql#aws-data-api). No bells and whistles, no Rust binaries, no serverless adapters, everything just works out of the box.

**Drizzle is serverless-ready by design**. It works in every major JavaScript runtime like NodeJS, Bun, Deno, Cloudflare Workers, Supabase functions, any Edge runtime, and even in browsers.  
With Drizzle you can be [**fast out of the box**](https://orm.drizzle.team/benchmarks) and save time and costs while never introducing any data proxies into your infrastructure. 

While you can use Drizzle as a JavaScript library, it shines with TypeScript. It lets you [**declare SQL schemas**](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/sql-schema-declaration) and build both [**relational**](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/rqb) and [**SQL-like queries**](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/select), while keeping the balance between type-safety and extensibility for toolmakers to build on top.  

### Ecosystem
While Drizzle ORM remains a thin typed layer on top of SQL, we made a set of tools for people to have best possible developer experience.  
  
Drizzle comes with a powerful [**Drizzle Kit**](https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/overview) CLI companion for you to have hassle-free migrations. It can generate SQL migration files for you or apply schema changes directly to the database.  
  
We also have [**Drizzle Studio**](https://orm.drizzle.team/drizzle-studio/overview) for you to effortlessly browse and manipulate data in your database of choice.
